### Project overview
Creating an application that can help students who are lost and alone during this pandemic.
The application will have a home page for alerts, to help students keep track of their module submissions. A study group page, for them to meet new friends taking the same modules. The calendar page tells them what day and time is their lecture and tutorials. Ths study progress page helps to remind students to maintain a good work life balance. Finally, the mental wellbeing page is for those who are feeling anxious and worried, to remind them that they are not alone and that they can seek help if needed.
